Queues were formed. If a computer was down, the messages would remain on the disk until the next computer was back up.\n\n## Research Networks (1960s-1980s)\nPacket Networks were used. \n- How to share one link so a long message doesn't block the flow?\n- How to deal with outages more dynamically.\n\nThe goal was **Half a second** to send a message across US.\n\nThe 20 year period was about **Efficient Message Transmission** like perfecting **Packet Switching**.\n\n## Packet Switching\n> Q: How do we move data simultaneously?\n\n> A: Break it into packets $\\to$ label each packet for sequence $\\to$ add a **to** and **from** address. \n> $\\therefore$ the receiver has everything they need to reconstruct the message even if the packets don't arrive in sequence.\n****\nThis lead to a shared network infrastructure where the computers no longer had to have lots of disk space or compute power. They only needed to forward packets. **A Router** \n\n$\\therefore$ They only focus on packets. Not reliability.\n\n## Layered Network Protocol\n> This approach was taken to break the problem of designing a network into smaller subproblems.\n\n|The Layers|\n|-|\n|Application Layer (Web, email, File Transfer) [[Internet.technology.application_layer]]|\n|Transport Layer (TCP) [[Internet.technology.transport_layer]]. Reliable Connections|\n|Internetwork Layer(IP) [[Internet.technology.ip]]. Simple, Scalable, Unreliable|\n|Link Layer [[Internet.technology.link_layer]] (Ethernet, WiFi). Physical Connections|\n\nWe currently follow the **TCP/IP** model.\nAlso existed was a 7 layer **OSI (Open System Interconnection)** model.\n\n\n## Domain Name System (DNS)\nIt converts user-friendly names like `www.umich.edu` to network-friendly names like `141.211.32.166`. \nIt can be thought of as being in between the **[[IP|Internet.technology.ip]]** layer and the **[[Transport|Internet.technology.transport_layer]]** layer.\n- IP Addresses reflect on technical \"geography\". Read left $\\to$ right\n- Domain names reflect on organizational structure. Read right $\\to$ left.\n\nSo a Domain Name like `www.sets.iub.edu.bd` is read like:\nIn Bangladesh $\\to$ an educational institution $\\to$ IUB $\\to$ SETS school of IUB $\\to$ www, a particular server at the school.\n\nOwnership of the Domain names are also right to left. \nOnly the domain owners of `.edu` can decide who can use the name. Once they allow an organization to use it, like `.umich.edu`, committee within U Michigan can decide who can use their name. Once a school like School of Information requests for it, then they can use `.si.umich.edu`.\n\n\n<!-- </body> -->\n\n","url":"https://shafayat1004.github.io/My-Notes/notes/SRJpDqbWI5BPydkk6Wal2.html","relUrl":"notes/SRJpDqbWI5BPydkk6Wal2.html"},{"doc":"transport_layer","title":"transport_layer","hpath":"Internet.technology.transport_layer","content":"# Transport Layer (TCP)\n\n> **[[IP|Internet.technology.ip]]** makes it so that packets with to and fromm addresses can travel from one network to another through 5-20 hops by keeping track of the best paths to follow.\n\nBut there is no guarantee of delivery, if things go bad, the data vanishes.\n\nThis is where TCP comes in, to deal with such scenarios.\n> **Purpose of TCP** is to compensate for the possible errors in the IP Layer and make best use of available resources.\n\nIt is built on top of IP.\nThe key thing it does is **keep a copy of the data** being sent **until** an **acknowledgement is received from the other end**.\nOnce that is received, only then the copy is thrown away.\nIf acknowledgement is taking too long, it sends the copy again.\n\nOne problem that was faced after it was first implemented was that packets were sent too slowly.\nThis was solved by [Van Jacobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson).\n\n\n    ","url":"https://shafayat1004.github.io/My-Notes/notes/qKU8QoVj4cRq3osZ8yB8N.html","relUrl":"notes/qKU8QoVj4cRq3osZ8yB8N.html"},{"doc":"SSL","title":"SSL","hpath":"Internet.technology.transport_layer.SSL","content":"\nSSL\n","url":"https://shafayat1004.github.io/My-Notes/notes/bY0NLJu3EP2Y1GisSgrkl.html","relUrl":"notes/bY0NLJu3EP2Y1GisSgrkl.html"},{"doc":"link_layer","title":"link_layer","hpath":"Internet.technology.link_layer","content":"\n# Link Layer (or Physical Layer)\nDeals with the problems connecting one computer to another computer. \n- Only worries about data across one **_hop_**. \n- Like what voltages to use, \n- How to send data. \n- How to deal with multiple computers using the same wire.\n\nThe tech that came out of this are\n- Ethernet\n- WiFi\n- Cable Modem\n- DSL\n- Satellite\n- Optical\n\n#### Link Layer Addresses\nAll link devices like Wireless Modules have a specific address built into them by the manufacturer. **MAC Address**\n> Q: How do we ensure that, in an environment where multiple devices are hooked to something like an Ethernet Hub or like a WiFi Network, if two devices want to talk to each other, they can so.\n\n> A: The address of the sender and receiver is encoded into the packet\n\n#### Avoiding Chaos\nFor Ethernet, it uses **Carrier Sense Media Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):**\n\n0.

Address ranges are assigned. They are based on where the station is connected.\n\n## IP Address Format\n- four numbers separated by dots.\n- each number is 1 $\\to$ 255, a 32-bit number\n- broken into two parts:\n    - Network Number (prefix), e.g 141.211.\\*.\\*\n    - Computer Number (within the network) e.g \\*.\\*.144.188\n\nWhen being packets are transmitted across the internet, only the prefix is looked at.\nWhen it reaches the Station with the assigned network number, only then is the suffix looked at to send the packet to the actual computer.\n    \n\nThey change their addresses, get reorganized once a while.\n\n**Routers** maintain **Router Tables** which are based on: \n- the destination network address\n- bandwidth on adjacent links\n- state of the neighbor nodes (up or not)\n- .....\n- .....\n    \n<!-- ## Router Tables -->\n\nRouters use these to determine the best outbound route to each network number.\nThey are also dynamic in adjusting their best paths by \"asking\" other routers for the best path.\nIf they encounter a new Network Address, they can ask their neighbor routers and their neighbor routers for the information.\n\n#### Problem of Computers that move around\n> Q: How is it so that a single device can send and receive data from the Internet even if it changes Network Addresses when being in different places?\n\n> A: When a device tries to enter a network, it asks for an IP address. The Access Point provides an IP address to the device that corresponds to the Network Address of the Access Point.\n\nThis is known as the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**\n\n**But there are a lot of devices!**\n\nDon't fret for there are special addresses known as :\n\n#### Non-Routable Addresses\nMoving from one house to another, we see that our IP is typically 192.168.\\*.\\*.\n\n- The ISP provides the home router a real global routable address.\n- But the router gives out local addresses with 192.168 as suffix.\n- This doesn't make sense in the internet and only the router knows what device the prefix maps to.\n- When a home device needs to access the internet, the router/access point/base station changes the Network Address of the packet to the ISP provided, routable, one. \n\nThis is done through a process called **Network Address Translation (NAT)**\n\n#### Problem of packets cycling across routers infinitely\nAn improperly configured network of routers may cause packets to cycle through then indefinitely. Since the world of the router is narrow, it only determines which path is best to follow. So there is no way to tackle the fact that the packets may be cycling due to improper configuration.\n\n**Solution:**\n>**Time to Live (TTL):** is a number assigned to an IP Packet that goes down by one each time the packet passes through a router. Usually starting from a value of 25. Can start from 255.\n\nThe routers, when they encounter a packet with TTL 0 after decrementing, they throw the packet away.\n**Then it sends a notification back to the sender indicating the packet was thrown away**\n\n#### Traceroute\n- Starts by sending a broken packet with a TTl of 1.\n- First Router sends notification back\n- Sends packet again with TTL of 2\n- packet reaches second router and second router sends notification again.\n- repeats until actual destination is reached\n- $\\therefore$ we can **trace** the **route** the packet took to reach the destination.\n\nIP works through **Best Effort**. It tries to efficiently transfer packets.\n**It does not guarantee delivery**.\nBut the flexible nature of it makes it so that its scalable to very large networks.
