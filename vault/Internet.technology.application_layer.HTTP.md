# HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol)

#### HTTP Request / Response Cycle
1. In a browser and a link is clicked.
1. Browser makes a connection to a web server.
1. Sends a `HTTP Request` for the document.
1. Receives a `HTTP Response` from the server.
1. Document gets displayed on the screen

When a link to a html page is clicked, a `GET` command is sent. e.g `GET /page2.html`.

The [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/) develops the standards for all of the Internet protocols (inner workings).
