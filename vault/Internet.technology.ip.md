# Internet Protocol (IP)

## IP Address Format
- four numbers separated by dots.
- each number is 1$\to$255, a 32-bit number
- broken into two parts:
    - Network Number (prefix), e.g 141.211.\*.\*
    - Computer Number (within the network) e.g \*.\*.144.188

When being packets are transmitted across the internet, only the prefix is looked at.
When it reaches the Station with the assigned network number, only then is the suffix looked at to send the packet to the actual computer.
