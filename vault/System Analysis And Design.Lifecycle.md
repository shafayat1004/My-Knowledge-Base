### The Systems Engineering Lifecycle

It is the highest level **technical** lifecycle for a product or system being built.
When a system is developed, people from multiple disciplines have to work together to make it.
It starts with a **system concept** and ends with **system integration**.

## General Model of a Lifecycle
They follow a sequence of phases or time period.
```mermaid

    Phase_1-->Phase_2
    Phase_2-->Phase_3
    Phase_3-->Phase_4
    Phase_4-->...
```
**The phases need not be equal in length.**
Each phase may have a sub-phase.

**Not all Lifecycles are sequential.**
There can be **Overlapping Phases**, **Parallel Phases**, **Repeated Cycles**.

### Typical Product Development Lifecycle

```
>**Phases:** Distinct **periods of time** during which development occurs.

>**Milestones:** **Events that mark phase boudaries**

>**Goals:** **Objectives** for each phase and overall development.
