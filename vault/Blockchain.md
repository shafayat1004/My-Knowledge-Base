### Bitcoin Blockchain
The [Satoshi Nakamoto White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) outlined how Bitcoin can be used to make P2P transactions in a decentralized network powered by cryptography. This allowed people to engage in censorship resistant finance.

There is a set amount of Bitcoin, making it scarce.

### Ethereum Protocol
It uses the same blockchain infrastructure but with additional features.

Using this, people can make decentralized applications/organizations. And make [[Smart Contracts|Blockchain.Smart Contracts]].

### Determinism
A "walled garden". Everything that happens in the blockchain happens inside it.
